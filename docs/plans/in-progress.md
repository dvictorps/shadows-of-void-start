# In-progress work

Decisions made but not yet executed. Read this before starting a session — if your task overlaps with something here, you may be duplicating planned work or causing conflicts.

When a planned item starts, move it to a feature branch and reference back here. When it ships, delete the entry (closed work belongs in commit history, not this file).

## Shared rarity-tinted card primitive (low priority refactor)

**Status**: Planned, not started.

**Why**: `src/components/world/MonsterTooltip.tsx` (added in `feat/zone-progression`) and `src/components/game/ItemTooltip.tsx` (in master) share non-trivial structure: identical `RARITY_COLORS` and `HEADER_BG` tables, identical `Separator` JSX, identical outer shell (tinted border + glow + `boxShadow` recipe + header-with-bg). The first two RARITY_COLORS rows of MonsterTooltip are a strict subset of ItemTooltip's 5-row map.

### Scope

- Lift `Separator` from `ItemTooltip` into a shared location (`src/components/ui/Separator.tsx` or similar).
- Centralize rarity-color tables (`RARITY_COLORS`, `HEADER_BG`) into a single source — perhaps `src/game/items/rarity-style.ts` re-exported by both tooltips.
- Optionally extract a `RarityCard` primitive (top accent line + tinted border + glow + header). Both tooltips consume it and add their own body content.

### Why deferred

The duplication is real but small enough that the refactor takes a focused PR. Doing it inline would have bloated `feat/zone-progression`. The current shape is correct; this is purely about reducing parallel maintenance.

## Native monster barrier

**Status**: Planned, not started. Triggered by the "Additional Barrier" monster mod from the zone-progression PR.

**Why**: today the `monsterAdditionalBarrier` mod folds into HP (`hp × 1.3`) as a placeholder because monsters have no barrier mechanism. The player has barrier (pool above HP, 6s recovery timer, full refill — see CONTEXT.md → Defenses → Barrier). Monsters should have the same shape so the mod's flavour matches its identity ("barrier above HP", not "more HP").

### Scope

- Extend `ScaledMonsterStats` with a `barrier: number` field (currently absent).
- Add `barrier` and `barrierRecoveryRemaining` to the live enemy state on `Enemy` (mirror the player's `BarrierState`).
- Reuse `damageBarrier()` / `tickBarrierRecovery()` from `src/game/combat/barrier.ts` on the enemy side of the combat tick.
- Update `monsterAdditionalBarrier` mod to grant a real barrier pool (e.g., `barrier += hp × 0.3`) instead of inflating HP.
- UI: render a thin blue strip above the enemy HP bar when barrier > 0 (mirror the player's HealthGlobe barrier ring).

### Validation

- `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx vitest run`
- Manual: roll a magic mob with Additional Barrier. Confirm barrier pool absorbs first, refills 6s after empty, doesn't refill while above zero.

## Future: rare-name bestiary (low priority)

**Status**: Idea parked. Not a priority — touches persistence, not combat feel.

**Why**: rares now get random proper names from the lexicon pools ("Garra de Aço, o Furioso" / "Stonemaw, the Furious"). Each spawn rolls a fresh `RareNameSeed` so the same monster type produces a different name every time. A bestiary would let the player accumulate the rares they've killed across runs — a memorable trophy log instead of forgotten flavor text.

### Scope sketch

- New Convex table `rareEncounters` keyed by characterId, storing: spawn seed, monster id, level, mods, killed-at timestamp, zone id. (Seed lets the renderer reproduce the same name later — the displayed string isn't stored, so locale-switch reads the right language out of the bestiary too.)
- `recordKill` mutation grows a branch: when `monsterRarity === "rare"`, also insert into `rareEncounters`.
- New world view (`/world` view mode `"bestiary"`, or a modal opened from the status card) lists past rares chronologically or by zone. Each entry renders via `translateEnemyName({ def, mods, rarity: "rare", nameSeed })`.
- Optional: count how many times the same `(monsterId, mod combo)` has been killed — repeat-kill stats add a collector dimension.

### Why deferred

Combat-feel work pays off the moment the player fights; persistence pays off later. The seed + mods are already first-class on the Enemy object, so the data plumbing is cheap when we get to it — no schema migration on monsters or names needed.

### Validation when picked up

- Add the table in `convex/schema.ts`, then in `convex/combat.ts:recordKill` upsert the encounter on rare kills.
- Manual: kill a rare, open the bestiary, see the same name. Switch locale — the bestiary entry renders in the new language. Kill a rare with the same monsterId, see a different name.

## Future: passive tree + active skills (not started)

Per CONTEXT.md → Classes, the order is:

1. MVP combat ✅ (done)
2. Passive tree (not started — needs design)
3. Active skills per class (not started — depends on passive tree)

When a session starts working on this, expect to add a third combat path (alongside attack/spell) for skill casts, and a major refactor to the stat engine to handle skill-gem-style modifier sources.

---

## Future: stash + vendor (not started)

Per CONTEXT.md → Stash and Vendor, the design is locked but no code exists:

- Stash: account-scoped, mode-isolated (softcore / hardcore), 60 slots + purchasable tabs.
- Vendor: per-act, sells consumables (potions today), buys gear for Rubys.
- Ruby: currency. Monsters never drop Rubys directly.

This is **scoped after** the passive tree because economy + progression need to balance against built characters.

## Future: anti-cheat / server-authoritative event validation

**Status**: Documented, deferred. See [docs/security/threat-model.md](../security/threat-model.md).

The current system is server-authoritative for **values** (HP cap, XP per monster, drops, prices) but trusts the **client for events** (kill happened, current HP). Two real exploits exist today:

1. `recordKill` spam — infinite XP + free loot/potions.
2. `syncHp` god mode — never die.

Both are documented with severity, mechanism, and layered fixes in the threat-model doc.

**Decision**: not implementing now. Impact is local (no leaderboard / trade / shared economy yet). Cost-benefit favors deferring.

**Triggers for starting**:

- Layer 1 (rate limits + zone preconditions, ~1-2h): public beta or any user-facing cheat concern.
- Layer 2 (session-based combat, ~4-6h): leaderboards, trade, or any feature where one player's progress affects another's.
- Layer 3 (server-tick combat, days): competitive mode with real value at stake.

When a session starts on this, read the threat-model doc first — it has the schema changes, acceptance criteria, and tradeoffs per layer.
